              The Pew Internet Project has looked at how people use the internet
              in four major ways: to communicate, to gather information, to
              transact personal and professional business, and to entertain
              themselves.)
              <br />
              <br />
              <h4 className="font-bold text-2xl mb-2">1. Communications</h4>
              <h3 className="font-bold text-xl mb-2">
                Men and women communicate online differently.
              </h3>
              In principle, internet users have high regard for the internet as
              a tool of communication; 85% of both men and women say they
              consider the internet to be a good way to interact or communicate
              with others in their everyday lives.14 But similarities end there.
              Men and women differ in their modes of online communication, in
              what they communicate about, and in how much they value their
              online communications.
              <br />
              <br />
              <h3 className="font-bold text-xl mb-2">
                Women are more voracious online communicators.
              </h3>
              Over the last 5 years, we have polled users about different forms
              of online communications, both through our regular tracking polls
              and through one-time modules on communications within topics as
              varied as health care, civic and community life, and email in the
              workplace. Women have always been slightly more likely than men to
              use email and to send cards, greetings and invitations and are
              pulling ahead of men in instant messaging and text messaging on
              cell phones. Men are more likely to have communicated online in
              chats or discussion groups and by making voice calls by voice over
              internet protocol, or VOIP.
              <br />
              <br />
              <h3 className="font-bold text-xl mb-2">Email is for everyone.</h3>
              Email has always been the most popular application on the
              internet. Over 90% of internet users send and receive email. Since
              we began tracking email use in 2000, the number of men and women
              who do email has been about equal, with women sometimes taking a
              slight lead. Further, on an average day, just about the same
              number of men and women will access their email. As for volume on
              a typical day, men and women also say they receive about the same
              number of emails in both their work and personal accounts. But
              what goes into those emails and how the application is valued
              differs for men and women.

                Women do more with personal email.
              </h3>
              In March 2001, we asked users about email habits with their most
              frequent email correspondents. Women proved to email about a wider
              variety of topics with both friends and family. They were more
              likely to correspond with the favored family member about getting
              together; to pass along some interesting non personal or personal
              news; to discuss worries as well as information about jobs or
              other activities; and to forward jokes or humorous stories. From
              time to time we have asked about emailing with family for other
              reasons. In November 2002, significantly more women than men said
              they emailed with family about health or medical issues. In March
              2003, significantly more women than men said they emailed with
              family about the likelihood of upcoming war in Iraq. Immediately
              after the events of September 11, 2001, more women than men said
              they emailed with family about news of terror attacks and their
              aftermath.
              <br />
              <br />
              With the favorite friend, the picture was much the same: Women
              emailed more than men about getting together, to discuss worries,
              to pass along personal news and information about jobs or other
              activities. In two cases, men were more likely to email about
              topics with a favored friend: to pass along some interesting non
              personal news, and to forward jokes or humorous stories. From time
              to time, we also asked users about emailing on various topics with
              friends. In November 2002, significantly more women than men said
              they emailed with friends about health or medical issues. In March
              2003, more women than men said they emailed with friends about the
              possibility of upcoming war in Iraq. Immediately after the events
              of September 11, 2001, more women than men said they emailed with
              friends about the terror attacks.

              <br />
              <h3 className="font-bold text-xl mb-2">
                Women find emailing with friends and family both more useful and
                more valuable than men do.
              </h3>
              <h3 className="font-bold text-xl mb-2">Where email is useful</h3>
              In November 2001, significantly more women than men said emailing
              with family is very useful to them. Slightly more women than men
              said this is true for friends, as well. Of the most important
              reasons they choose to email with family, both men and women say
              convenience, 30% for men and 27% for women, and speed, 29% for men
              and 30% for women. More women, 19%, than men, 12%, appreciate that
              email is inexpensive. And 12% of both men and women find it useful
              for attaching pictures or documents to the emails. Both men and
              women say the most important reason they choose to email with
              friends is also for convenience, 39% each for men and women. That
              is followed by speed, 31% for men, compared with 30% for women,
              and that it’s less expensive, 14% for women and 8% for men, and
              that they can attach pictures or documents, 11% for men and 9% for
              women.

                Where email is valuable
              </h3>
              We asked about some of the softer measures of the value of email.
              In March 2001, more women, 43%, than men, 33%, said that
              communicating by email has improved relationships with their
              family members. More women than men said email has brought them
              closer to their family, and that they have learned more about
              their family by using email. With respect to their friends, some
              49% of women say this improved relationships with friends compared
              with 39% of men. More women than men say email has brought them
              closer to their friends and that they have learned more about
              friends by using email. In November 2001, significantly more
              women, 52%, than men 45% , said they would miss using email a lot
              if they could no longer use it.
              <br />
              <br />
              <h3 className="font-bold text-xl mb-2">
                Women find emailing at work more effective and valuable than men
                do.
              </h3>
              In May 2002, we asked users a battery of questions to compare
              email with phone or face-to-face contact for handling various
              tasks at work. More women than men named email as the most
              effective way to handle every work situation we queried: to make
              appointments; to edit or review documents; to ask questions about
              work issues; and to deal with problems with supervisors. Women
              were also consistently more likely than men to see email as a
              positive force in the workplace. More women than men said email
              improves teamwork in the workplace; expands their circle of
              colleagues at work; makes them more available to co-workers; helps
              them stay current with events at work; provides moments of relief
              from work; saves them time; and liberates them from being tied to
              the office.
              <br />
              <br />
              Women were less likely than men to cite email’s negative effects.
              Women were less likely to say email makes it too easy for
              outsiders to reach them and makes them too accessible to others
              inside the company. Men and women were equally likely to consider
              email at work to be a source of stress, gossip, misunderstanding,
              and to say they can’t get away from it. Overall, more women, 20%,
              than men, 15%, give email in the workplace the highest praise,
              saying they “can’t live without it.”
              <br />
              <br />
              <h3 className="font-bold text-xl mb-2">
                Men use the internet more than women to communicate and discuss
                issues with special interest groups.
              </h3>
              In February 2001, we found that 84% of internet users belonged to
              some kind of online group or organization and that many of them
              had joined those groups after they had gotten internet access. In
              that survey there were some differences between men and women and
              the kinds of groups to which they belonged. More men said they
              went to the internet to communicate with or get information from a
              variety of special interest groups: trade and professional groups;
              hobby or interest groups; fan groups for a sport or sports team;
              groups for a sport team they participate in; lifestyle groups;
              groups for those who share personal beliefs; and political groups.
              For a number of other groups, men and women responded equally:
              entertainment fan groups; local or community groups; religious,
              cultural or ethnic groups; and labor unions. More women said they
              went to support groups for medical or personal situations. When
              asked about the special interest group they contact most often,
              nearly equal numbers of men, 63%, and women, 57%, say they use
              email. Also, significantly more men, 65%, than women, 53%, said
              they read or post messages on a special group’s listserv or
              bulletin board. Using email with special interest groups is
              important to both men and women for getting hard news and
              information. Significantly more men than women think that
              discussing issues is an important reason to email with these
              special interest groups. More women than men say that maintaining
              or building personal relationships among group members is
              important to them.

              <br />
              <h4 className="font-bold text-2xl mb-2">2. Transactions</h4>
              Men do more a few more online transactions than women, including
              some with less predictable or controlled outcomes.
              <br />
              <br />
              In their day-to-day lives, 75% of internet users believe that the
              internet offers them a good way to conduct their everyday business
              like banking or buying tickets, although men, at 78%, say this in
              significantly higher numbers than women, at 71%.15 Over the last
              five years, the Pew Internet Project has been tracking users’
              participation in more than a dozen kinds of online transactions.
              Men and women are about equally likely to go online to do many of
              these: to buy products, as well as everyday items like groceries,
              food, and household items and prescriptions; to make travel
              arrangements or to purchase tickets; to do their banking; and to
              donate to charities.
              <br />
              <br />
              Men are significantly more likely to pay bills online and to pay
              for online content. They are also more likely to do more of the
              online transactions with less predictable outcomes: bidding in
              auctions and trading stocks, bonds or mutual funds. A very small
              and equal number of both men and women also order from unsolicited
              email and gamble online.
              <br />
              <br />
              <h3 className="font-bold text-xl mb-2">
                Men and women share an increasing enthusiasm for doing
                transactions on the internet.
              </h3>
              The ability to do different kinds of transactions online has been
              one of the biggest attractions of the internet over the last few
              years. Participation rates among some of the transactional
              activities the Pew Internet Project has tracked regularly have
              eclipsed those for other online functions, including
              communications, getting information, and enjoying entertainment.
              <br />
              <br />
              Participation in online banking grew from 17% in 2000 to 41% in
              2005; in doing travel arrangements online grew from about a third
              in 2000 to nearly two-thirds in 2004; in buying products like
              books, music, toys, and clothing from 48% in 2000 to 67% in 2004;
              in online auctions from 15% overall in 2000 to 24% in 2005,
              including men’s rate from 19% to 30%, and women’s from 11% to 18%.
              <br />
              <br />
              Some online transaction activities have not taken off as
              dramatically. In March 2000, 16% of men and 9% of women bought or
              sold stocks. By November 2004, men’s participation rose to 20%,
              while women’s fell to 6%.
              <h3 className="font-bold text-xl mb-2">
                Men and women like online transactions for mostly the same
                reasons, with convenience and speed leading.
              </h3>
              The Pew Internet Project has polled internet users about the
              reasons they value three online transactions, banking, shopping,
              and buying prescriptions.
              <br />
              <br />
              Men and women share most reasons they value online banking. About
              three-quarters of both men and women said they appreciated both
              the convenience and time savings. Many also said they appreciate
              the privacy of online banking and the accessibility to so much
              information and so many services online. Men and women differed
              significantly in only one element: More women than men said they
              valued online banking for the savings in cost.
              <br />
              <br />
              For online shopping, both men and women cite convenience and time
              savings as major reasons to like shopping online. Further, more
              men than women value cost savings, and more women than men
              appreciate the chance to find unusual gifts. And finally in June
              2004, both men and women cited convenience and savings of time and
              money as very important reasons to have bought prescription drugs
              online, although the overall number of internet users who have
              bought drugs online remains very low, about 4%.

              </h4>
              <h3 className="font-bold text-xl">
                All internet users have a high regard for the internet as a
                source of information, but men look for a broader range of
                information online than women do.
              </h3>
              <br />
              <br />
              Nearly all internet users, 91%, agree that the internet is a good
              source of information for everyday interests like news, weather
              reports, and sports scores.16 About 80% of both men and women also
              expect to find information online about more specialized topics of
              government issues and health or medical issues. The same number
              also say they expect to find information on particular products
              they want to purchase, although this includes more men, 82%, than
              women, 77%. About a third of internet users say they expect to
              find reliable information online
              <br />
              <br />
              about individuals.17
              <br />
              <br />
              Beginning in 2000, we asked users about the kinds of information
              they look for online. Men and women are equally likely to get
              travel information and to look up phone numbers and addresses.
              They also look for information about the government, about
              colleges, jobs, and places to live. Significantly more men than
              women go online to get news and financial information, to check
              the weather and look up sports scores. Men also do research about
              products and services as well as research for their jobs. They
              look up more how-to information. More women look for health and
              medical information, for maps and driving instructions and for
              information on religion.

                In emergencies, more men use the internet to focus on
                information and more women to focus on people.
              </h3>
              The Pew Internet Project looked in depth at a few extraordinary
              instances where users might go to the internet for information. In
              the fall of 2001, we asked users about the kinds of websites they
              had visited after the events of September 11. Significantly more
              men had visited a larger variety of different kinds of websites
              that would be sources of information, including news media sites,
              business sites, government or military sites, international sites,
              political sites, discussion groups, and portals. Men and women
              were equally as likely to visit personal websites, sites for
              charities, religious groups, and interest or advocacy groups. In
              the same survey, we asked users how the internet helped through
              the events of September 11. More men, 30%, than women, 25%, said
              the internet helped them a lot to learn more about what was going
              on, while more women, 56%, than men, 50%, said it helped them
              connect with people they needed to reach. These differences are
              statistically significant.

              <h3 className="font-bold text-xl mb-2">
                Men and women share similar search habits to get information.
              </h3>
              In September 2005, about 90% of both men and women were using
              search engines to find information. Women’s history with search
              engine use is more volatile than men’s. In June 2003, 88% of women
              used search engines; it dipped to 79% in June 2004, and rose back
              to 91% in September 2005. Men’s use has held steady at about 90%.
              <br />
              <br />
              The rise in search engine use on an average day, from about 35%
              for men and 25% for women in June 2003 and June 2004, soared for
              both in September 2005, to 43% for men and 39% for women. This
              coincides with the recent popular excitement about major search
              engines, including the vastly expanding volume searchable content,
              the IPOs, and the widely reported competition among them.
              <br />
              <br />
              Search engines are just one way to find information online. As
              alternatives, searchers return to familiar websites or follow
              recommended links. The Pew Internet Project looked more closely at
              searchers’ strategies for three specific kinds of informational
              searches: for health and medical issues, government issues, and
              religious issues.
              <br />
              <br />
              Men and women use similar strategies in launching their searches.
              Most users who are looking for information about health or
              government issues will start with search engines or portals. For
              instance, when asked about their most recent searches for health
              information, 85% of men and 78% of women said they went first to
              search engines or to general portals that included search
              engines.18 Similarly, when asked about the last time they searched
              for government information or services, 48% of men and 51% of
              women started at engines or portals.19 Then, as a secondary
              strategy, 29% of men and 28% of women went to sites they had
              already used. In looking for religious information, both men, 44%,
              and women, 49%, were most likely to start their searches at
              familiar religious websites.20 Both turned to search engines or
              general portals as a second resort; 37% of men and 35% of women.
              <br />
              <br />
              Women handle less information online but feel the information glut
              more. Although men gather and consume more information online,
              women seem more overwhelmed by the volume of information around
              them. In October 2002, we asked users about their sense of
              information overload in the context of growing volumes of
              easily-attainable information from TV, newspapers, online
              information services, magazines, etc. Although most users,
              including 65% of women and 70% of men, said they like having lots
              of information, significantly more women, 24%, than men, 19%, felt
              overloaded by it.

              <h4 className="font-bold mb-2 text-2xl">4. Entertainment</h4>
              Men participate in more kinds of online entertainment than women.
              Just over two thirds of users think the internet is a good place
              to pursue entertainment or personal enjoyment, including
              significantly more men, 72%, than women, 66%.21 Over the years,
              the Pew Internet Project has asked internet users about a grab bag
              of activities they do online for fun, recreation, and
              entertainment. Men and women participate equally in about half the
              activities we polled, but men are more likely than women to
              participate in the rest of the activities.
              <br />
              <br />
              In the light entertainment category, about two-thirds of men and
              women surf the web for fun. With hobbies, slightly more men than
              women go online looking for information about their hobbies and
              many more actually pursuing their special interests online. Men
              also participate more seriously than women in sports fantasy
              leagues. A small but equal number of men and women said they have
              gone online to play the lottery or gamble.
              <br />
              <br />
              We have occasionally asked users about visiting adult websites.
              The overall participation rates have remained constant, from about
              13% – 15%. Traditionally, three to five times as many men as women
              have responded positively to this question.
              <br />
              <br />
              Men have recently closed the gap with women in playing online
              games. Women have traditionally led men in this data point; as
              late as November 2004, significantly more women, 44%, than men,
              34%, said they had played games online. In that same survey, about
              equal numbers of men and women also said they downloaded such
              games to play online.22 Among more serious endeavors,
              significantly more men than women said they read for pleasure
              online and have taken a class online for personal enjoyment or
              enrichment.
              <br />
              <br />
              Men do more online watching and listening
              <br />
              <br />
              We have asked about online audio and video activities in a variety
              of ways. Overall, men are more enthusiastic than women about using
              the internet as kind an entertainment center for watching and
              listening. Just over half of both online men and women have
              watched video clips or listened to audio clips online, a number
              that has risen slowly but steadily over the last 5 years, with
              women closing an earlier gap. About a third of internet users,
              including significantly more men than women, have listened to
              music online at websites of places like a radio station, music
              store, recording artist or music service. Similar numbers have
              listened to live or recorded broadcasts of shows like newscasts,
              sporting events, or a radio show.
              <br />
              <br />
              We also asked about downloaded entertainment. About a quarter of
              users have downloaded music files for later, anytime use,
              including significantly more men than women. This number had been
              growing to nearly a third of internet users at the end of 2002 and
              the first half of 2003, when suits against illegal file sharing
              brought by the Recording Industry Association of America
              encouraged many internet users to stop downloading music. In June
              2003, the total number was 30%. By November 2003, the
              participation rate fell to 14%. The number has risen since then to
              the current 25% in May 2005. Men have always led women in
              downloading.
              <br />
              <br />
              Significantly more men than women have downloaded other kinds of
              files as well, including video files, games, and picture files.
              <br />
              <br />
              An equal number of men and women, about a quarter of all internet
              users, have shared various kinds of files as well.
              <br />
              <br />
              In a first-time question in January 2005, we also asked users if
              they ever take online material, like songs, text, or images to
              remix. Significantly more men than women have done this
