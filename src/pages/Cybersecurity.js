              This is a list of cybersecurity information technology. Cybersecurity is security as it is applied
to information technology. This includes all technology that stores, manipulates, or moves data,
such as computers, data networks, and all devices connected to or included in networks, such
as routers and switches. All information technology devices and facilities need to be secured
against intrusion, unauthorized use, and vandalism. Additionally, the users of information
technology should be protected from theft of assets, extortion, identity theft, loss of privacy
and confidentiality of personal information, malicious mischief, damage to equipment, business
process compromise, and the general activity of cybercriminals. The public should be protected
against acts of cyberterrorism, such as the compromise or loss of the electric power grid.
Cybersecurity is a major endeavor of the IT industry. There are a number of professional
certifications given for cybersecurity training and expertise.[1] Although billions of dollars are
spent annually on cybersecurity, no computer or network is immune from attacks or can be
considered completely secure. The single most expensive loss due to a cybersecurity exploit
was the ILOVEYOU or Love Bug email worm of 2000, which cost an estimated 8.7 billion
American dollars.[2]<br /><br />

CryptographyEdit<br /><br />
The art of secret writing or code. A "plaintext" message is converted by the sender to
"ciphertext" by means of a mathematical algorithm that uses a secret key. The receiver of the
message then reverses the process and converts the ciphertext back to the original plaintext.[7]<br /><br />
