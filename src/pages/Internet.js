              <div class="mb-10">
                The Internet (or internet)[a] is the global system of
                interconnected computer networks that uses the Internet protocol
                suite (TCP/IP)[b] to communicate between networks and devices.
                It is a network of networks that consists of private, public,
                academic, business, and government networks of local to global
                scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and
                optical networking technologies. The Internet carries a vast
                range of information resources and services, such as the
                inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World
                Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and file sharing.
                <br />
                <br />
                The origins of the Internet date back to the development of
                packet switching and research commissioned by the United States
                Department of Defense in the 1960s to enable time-sharing of
                computers.[2] The primary precursor network, the ARPANET,
                initially served as a backbone for interconnection of regional
                academic and military networks in the 1970s. The funding of the
                National Science Foundation Network as a new backbone in the
                1980s, as well as private funding for other commercial
                extensions, led to worldwide participation in the development of
                new networking technologies, and the merger of many networks.[3]
                The linking of commercial networks and enterprises by the early
                1990s marked the beginning of the transition to the modern
                Internet,[4] and generated a sustained exponential growth as
                generations of institutional, personal, and mobile computers
                were connected to the network. Although the Internet was widely
                used by academia in the 1980s, commercialization incorporated
                its services and technologies into virtually every aspect of
                modern life.
                <br />
                <br /> Most traditional communication media, including
                telephony, radio, television, paper mail and newspapers are
                reshaped, redefined, or even bypassed by the Internet, giving
                birth to new services such as email, Internet telephony,
                Internet television, online music, digital newspapers, and video
                streaming websites. Newspaper, book, and other print publishing
                are adapting to website technology, or are reshaped into
                blogging, web feeds and online news aggregators. The Internet
                has enabled and accelerated new forms of personal interactions
                through instant messaging, Internet forums, and social
                networking services. Online shopping has grown exponentially for
                major retailers, small businesses, and entrepreneurs, as it
                enables firms to extend their "brick and mortar" presence to
                serve a larger market or even sell goods and services entirely
                online. Business-to-business and financial services on the
                Internet affect supply chains across entire industries.
                <br />
                <br /> The Internet has no single centralized governance in
                either technological implementation or policies for access and
                usage; each constituent network sets its own policies.[5] The
                overreaching definitions of the two principal name spaces in the
                Internet, the Internet Protocol address (IP address) space and
                the Domain Name System (DNS), are directed by a maintainer
                organization, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and
                Numbers (ICANN). The technical underpinning and standardization
                of the core protocols is an activity of the Internet Engineering
                Task Force (IETF), a non-profit organization of loosely
                affiliated international participants that anyone may associate
                with by contributing technical expertise.[6] In November 2006,
                the Internet was included on USA Today's list of New Seven
                Wonders.[7]

                <br /> The word internetted was used as early as 1849, meaning
                interconnected or interwoven. [8] The word Internet was used in
                1974 as the shorthand form of Internetwork.[9] Today, the term
                Internet most commonly refers to the global system of
                interconnected computer networks, though it may also refer to
                any group of smaller networks.[10]
                <br />
                <br /> When it came into common use, most publications treated
                the word Internet as a capitalized proper noun; this has become
                less common.[10] This reflects the tendency in English to
                capitalize new terms and move to lowercase as they become
                familiar.[10][11] The word is sometimes still capitalized to
                distinguish the global internet from smaller networks, though
                many publications, including the AP Stylebook since 2016,
                recommend the lowercase form in every case.[10][11] In 2016, the
                Oxford English Dictionary found that, based on a study of around
                2.5 billion printed and online sources, "Internet" was
                capitalized in 54% of cases.[12]
                <br />
                <br /> The terms Internet and World Wide Web are often used
                interchangeably; it is common to speak of "going on the
                Internet" when using a web browser to view web pages. However,
                the World Wide Web or the Web is only one of a large number of
                Internet services,[13] a collection of documents (web pages) and
                other web resources, linked by hyperlinks and URLs.[14]

                Web3 is distinct from Tim Berners-Lee's 1999 concept for a
                semantic web.[19] In 2006, Berners-Lee described the semantic
                web as a component of Web 3.0, which is different from the
                meaning of Web3 in blockchain contexts.[20] The term "Web3" was
                coined by Polkadot founder and Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood in
                2014, referring to a "decentralized online ecosystem based on
                blockchain."[1] In 2021, the idea of Web3 gained popularity.[21]
                Particular interest spiked toward the end of 2021, largely due
                to interest from cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investments from
                high-profile technologists and companies.[6][7]
                <br />
                <br /> Executives from venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz
                traveled to Washington, D.C. in October 2021 to lobby for the
                idea as a potential solution to questions about regulation of
                the web, with which policymakers have been grappling.[22] Some
                writers referring to the decentralized concept usually known as
                "Web3" have used the term "Web 3.0", leading to some confusion
                between the two concepts.[2][3] Furthermore, some visions of
                Web3 also incorporate ideas relating to the semantic web.[9]

                <br />
                In the 1960s, the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of
                the United States Department of Defense funded research into
                time-sharing of computers.[15][16][17] Research into packet
                switching, one of the fundamental Internet technologies, started
                in the work of Paul Baran in the early 1960s and, independently,
                Donald Davies in 1965.[2][18] After the Symposium on Operating
                Systems Principles in 1967, packet switching from the proposed
                NPL network was incorporated into the design for the ARPANET and
                other resource sharing networks such as the Merit Network and
                CYCLADES, which were developed in the late 1960s and early
                1970s.[19] ARPANET development began with two network nodes
                which were interconnected between the Network Measurement Center
                at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Henry
                Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science directed by
                Leonard Kleinrock, and the NLS system at SRI International (SRI)
                by Douglas Engelbart in Menlo Park, California, on 29 October
                1969.[20] The third site was the Culler-Fried Interactive
                Mathematics Center at the University of California, Santa
                Barbara, followed by the University of Utah Graphics Department.
                In a sign of future growth, 15 sites were connected to the young
                ARPANET by the end of 1971.[21] [22] These early years were
                documented in the 1972 film Computer Networks: The Heralds of
                Resource Sharing.[23]
                <br />
                <br />
                Early international collaborations for the ARPANET were rare.
                Connections were made in 1973 to the Norwegian Seismic Array
                (NORSAR) via a satellite station in Tanum, Sweden, and to Peter
                Kirstein's research group at University College London which
                provided a gateway to British academic networks.[24][25] The
                ARPA projects and international working groups led to the
                development of various protocols and standards by which multiple
                separate networks could become a single network or "a network of
                networks".[26] In 1974, Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn used the term
                internet as a shorthand for internetwork in RFC 675,[9] and
                later RFCs repeated this use.[27] Cerf and Kahn credit Louis
                Pouzin with important influences on TCP/IP design. [28]
                Commercial PTT providers were concerned with developing X.25
                public data networks.[29] Access to the ARPANET was expanded in
                1981 when the National Science Foundation (NSF) funded the
                Computer Science Network (CSNET). In 1982, the Internet Protocol
                Suite (TCP/ IP) was standardized, which permitted worldwide
                proliferation of interconnected networks. TCP/IP network access
                expanded again in 1986 when the National Science Foundation
                Network (NSFNet) provided access to supercomputer sites in the
                United States for researchers, first at speeds of 56 kbit/s and
                later at 1.5 Mbit/s and 45 Mbit/s.[30] The NSFNet expanded into
                academic and research organizations in Europe, Australia, New
                Zealand and Japan in 1988–89.[31][32][33][34] Although other
                network protocols such as UUCP had global reach well before this
                time, this marked the beginning of the Internet as an
                intercontinental network. Commercial Internet service providers
                (ISPs) emerged in 1989 in the United States and Australia.[35]
                The ARPANET was decommissioned in 1990.[36] T3 NSFNET Backbone,
                c. 1992.
                <br />
                <br />
                Steady advances in semiconductor technology and optical
                networking created new economic opportunities for commercial
                involvement in the expansion of the network in its core and for
                delivering services to the public. In mid-1989, MCI Mail and
                Compuserve established connections to the Internet, delivering
                email and public access products to the half million users of
                the Internet.[37] Just months later, on 1 January 1990, PSInet
                launched an alternate Internet backbone for commercial use; one
                of the networks that added to the core of the commercial
                Internet of later years. In March 1990, the first high-speed T1
                (1.5 Mbit/s) link between the NSFNET and Europe was installed
                between Cornell University and CERN, allowing much more robust
                communications than were capable with satellites.[38] Six months
                later Tim Berners-Lee would begin writing WorldWideWeb, the
                first web browser, after two years of lobbying CERN management.
                By Christmas 1990, Berners-Lee had built all the tools necessary
                for a working Web: the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
                0.9,[39] the HyperText Markup Language (HTML), the first Web
                browser (which was also a HTML editor and could access Usenet
                newsgroups and FTP files), the first HTTP server software (later
                known as CERN httpd), the first web server,[40] and the first
                Web pages that described the project itself. In 1991 the
                Commercial Internet eXchange was founded, allowing PSInet to
                communicate with the other commercial networks CERFnet and
                Alternet. Stanford Federal Credit Union was the first financial
                institution to offer online Internet banking services to all of
                its members in October 1994.[41] In 1996, OP Financial Group,
                also a cooperative bank, became the second online bank in the
                world and the first in Europe.[42] By 1995, the Internet was
                fully commercialized in the U.S. when the NSFNet was
                decommissioned, removing the last restrictions on use of the
                Internet to carry commercial traffic.[43]

                Internet traffic started experiencing similar characteristics as
                that of the scaling of MOS transistors, exemplified by Moore's
                law, doubling every 18 months. This growth, formalized as
                Edholm's law, was catalyzed by advances in MOS technology, laser
                light wave systems, and noise performance.[47]
                <br />
                <br />
                Since 1995, the Internet has tremendously impacted culture and
                commerce, including the rise of near instant communication by
                email, instant messaging, telephony (Voice over Internet
                Protocol or VoIP), two-way interactive video calls, and the
                World Wide Web[48] with its discussion forums, blogs, and online
                shopping sites. Increasing amounts of data are transmitted at
                higher and higher speeds over fiber optic networks operating at
                1 Gbit/s, 10 Gbit/s, or more. The Internet continues to grow,
                driven by ever greater amounts of online information and
                knowledge, commerce, entertainment and social networking
                services.[49] During the late 1990s, it was estimated that
                traffic on the public Internet grew by 100 percent per year,
                while the mean annual growth in the number of Internet users was
                thought to be between 20% and 50%.[50] This growth is often
                attributed to the lack of central administration, which allows
                organic growth of the network, as well as the non-proprietary
                nature of the Internet protocols, which encourages vendor
                interoperability and prevents any one company from exerting too
                much control over the network.[51] As of 31 March 2011, the
                estimated total number of Internet users was 2.095 billion
                (30.2% of world population).[52] It is estimated that in 1993
                the Internet carried only 1% of the information flowing through
                two-way telecommunication. By 2000 this figure had grown to 51%,
                and by 2007 more than 97% of all telecommunicated information
                was carried over the Internet.[53]

                ICANN headquarters in the Playa Vista neighborhood of Los
                Angeles, California, United States. The Internet is a global
                network that comprises many voluntarily interconnected
                autonomous networks. It operates without a central governing
                body. The technical underpinning and standardization of the core
                protocols (IPv4 and IPv6) is an activity of the Internet
                Engineering Task Force (IETF), a non-profit organization of
                loosely affiliated international participants that anyone may
                associate with by contributing technical expertise. To maintain
                interoperability, the principal name spaces of the Internet are
                administered by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and
                Numbers (ICANN). ICANN is governed by an international board of
                directors drawn from across the Internet technical, business,
                academic, and other non-commercial communities. ICANN
                coordinates the assignment of unique identifiers for use on the
                Internet, including domain names, IP addresses, application port
                numbers in the transport protocols, and many other parameters.
                Globally unified name spaces are essential for maintaining the
                global reach of the Internet. This role of ICANN distinguishes
                it as perhaps the only central coordinating body for the global
                Internet.[54]

                Regional Internet registries (RIRs) were established for five
                regions of the world. The African Network Information Center
                (AfriNIC) for Africa, the American Registry for Internet Numbers
                (ARIN) for North America, the Asia-Pacific Network Information
                Centre (APNIC) for Asia and the Pacific region, the Latin
                American and Caribbean Internet Addresses Registry (LACNIC) for
                Latin America and the Caribbean region, and the Réseaux IP
                Européens – Network Coordination Centre (RIPE NCC) for Europe,
                the Middle East, and Central Asia were delegated to assign IP
                address blocks and other Internet parameters to local
                registries, such as Internet service providers, from a
                designated pool of addresses set aside for each region. The
                National Telecommunications and Information Administration, an
                agency of the United States Department of Commerce, had final
                approval over changes to the DNS root zone until the IANA
                stewardship transition on 1 October 2016.[55][56][57][58] The
                Internet Society (ISOC) was founded in 1992 with a mission to
                "assure the open development, evolution and use of the Internet
                for the benefit of all people throughout the world".[59] Its
                members include individuals (anyone may join) as well as
                corporations, organizations, governments, and universities.
                Among other activities ISOC provides an administrative home for
                a number of less formally organized groups that are involved in
                developing and managing the Internet, including: the IETF,
                Internet Architecture Board (IAB), Internet Engineering Steering
                Group (IESG), Internet Research Task Force (IRTF), and Internet
                Research Steering Group (IRSG). On 16 November 2005, the United
                Nations-sponsored World Summit on the Information Society in
                Tunis established the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) to discuss
                Internet-related issues.

                around the world. The communications infrastructure of the
                Internet consists of its hardware components and a system of
                software layers that control various aspects of the
                architecture. As with any computer network, the Internet
                physically consists of routers, media (such as cabling and radio
                links), repeaters, modems etc. However, as an example of
                internetworking, many of the network nodes are not necessarily
                internet equipment per se, the internet packets are carried by
                other full-fledged networking protocols with the Internet acting
                as a homogeneous networking standard, running across
                heterogeneous hardware, with the packets guided to their
                destinations by IP routers.

                <h4 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Service tiers</h4>
                Packet routing across the Internet involves several tiers of
                Internet service providers. Internet service providers (ISPs)
                establish the worldwide connectivity between individual networks
                at various levels of scope. End-users who only access the
                Internet when needed to perform a function or obtain
                information, represent the bottom of the routing hierarchy. At
                the top of the routing hierarchy are the tier 1 networks, large
                telecommunication companies that exchange traffic directly with
                each other via very high speed fibre optic cables and governed
                by peering agreements. Tier 2 and lower-level networks buy
                Internet transit from other providers to reach at least some
                parties on the global Internet, though they may also engage in
                peering. An ISP may use a single upstream provider for
                connectivity, or implement multihoming to achieve redundancy and
                load balancing. Internet exchange points are major traffic
                exchanges with physical connections to multiple ISPs. Large
                organizations, such as academic institutions, large enterprises,
                and governments, may perform the same function as ISPs, engaging
                in peering and purchasing transit on behalf of their internal
                networks. Research networks tend to interconnect with large
                subnetworks such as GEANT, GLORIAD, Internet2, and the UK's
                national research and education network, JANET.

                <h4 className="font-bold mb-2 text-2xl">Access</h4>
                Common methods of Internet access by users include dial-up with
                a computer modem via telephone circuits, broadband over coaxial
                cable, fiber optics or copper wires, Wi-Fi, satellite, and
                cellular telephone technology (e.g. 3G, 4G). The Internet may
                often be accessed from computers in libraries and Internet
                cafes. Internet access points exist in many public places such
                as airport halls and coffee shops. Various terms are used, such
                as public Internet kiosk, public access terminal, and Web
                payphone. Many hotels also have public terminals that are
                usually fee-based. These terminals are widely accessed for
                various usages, such as ticket booking, bank deposit, or online
                payment. Wi-Fi provides wireless access to the Internet via
                local computer networks. Hotspots providing such access include
                Wi-Fi cafes, where users need to bring their own wireless
                devices such as a laptop or PDA. These services may be free to
                all, free to customers only, or fee-based.
                <br />
                <br />
                Grassroots efforts have led to wireless community networks.
                Commercial Wi-Fi services that cover large areas are available
                in many cities, such as New York, London, Vienna, Toronto, San
                Francisco, Philadelphia, Chicago and Pittsburgh, where the
                Internet can then be accessed from places such as a park
                bench.[60] Experiments have also been conducted with proprietary
                mobile wireless networks like Ricochet, various high-speed data
                services over cellular networks, and fixed wireless services.
                Modern smartphones can also access the Internet through the
                cellular carrier network. For Web browsing, these devices
                provide applications such as Google Chrome, Safari, and Firefox
                and a wide variety of other Internet software may be installed
                from app-stores. Internet usage by mobile and tablet devices
                exceeded desktop worldwide for the first time in October
                2016.[61]

                  Mobile communication
                </h4>
                Number of mobile cellular subscriptions 2012–2016 The
                International Telecommunication Union (ITU) estimated that, by
                the end of 2017, 48% of individual users regularly connect to
                the Internet, up from 34% in 2012.[62] Mobile Internet
                connectivity has played an important role in expanding access in
                recent years especially in Asia and the Pacific and in
                Africa.[63] The number of unique mobile cellular subscriptions
                increased from 3.89 billion in 2012 to 4.83 billion in 2016,
                two-thirds of the world's population, with more than half of
                subscriptions located in Asia and the Pacific. The number of
                subscriptions is predicted to rise to 5.69 billion users in
                2020.[64] As of 2016, almost 60% of the world's population had
                access to a 4G broadband cellular network, up from almost 50% in
                2015 and 11% in 2012.[disputed – discuss][64] The limits that
                users face on accessing information via mobile applications
                coincide with a broader process of fragmentation of the
                Internet. Fragmentation restricts access to media content and
                tends to affect poorest users the most.[63]

                Zero-rating, the practice of Internet service providers allowing
                users free connectivity to access specific content or
                applications without cost, has offered opportunities to surmount
                economic hurdles, but has also been accused by its critics as
                creating a two-tiered Internet. To address the issues with
                zero-rating, an alternative model has emerged in the concept of
                'equal rating' and is being tested in experiments by Mozilla and
                Orange in Africa. Equal rating prevents prioritization of one
                type of content and zero-rates all content up to a specified
                data cap. A study published by Chatham House, 15 out of 19
                countries researched in Latin America had some kind of hybrid or
                zero-rated product offered. Some countries in the region had a
                handful of plans to choose from (across all mobile network
                operators) while others, such as Colombia, offered as many as 30
                pre-paid and 34 post-paid plans.[65] A study of eight countries
                in the Global South found that zero-rated data plans exist in
                every country, although there is a great range in the frequency
                with which they are offered and actually used in each.[66] The
                study looked at the top three to five carriers by market share
                in Bangladesh, Colombia, Ghana, India, Kenya, Nigeria, Peru and
                Philippines. Across the 181 plans examined, 13 per cent were
                offering zero-rated services. Another study, covering Ghana,
                Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa, found Facebook's Free Basics
                and Wikipedia Zero to be the most commonly zero-rated
                content.[67]

                  Internet Protocol Suite
                </h4>
                The Internet standards describe a framework known as the
                Internet protocol suite (also called TCP/IP, based on the first
                two components.) This is a suite of protocols that are ordered
                into a set of four conceptional layers by the scope of their
                operation, originally documented in RFC 1122 and RFC 1123. At
                the top is the application layer, where communication is
                described in terms of the objects or data structures most
                appropriate for each application. For example, a web browser
                operates in a client–server application model and exchanges
                information with the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and an
                application-germane data structure, such as the Hypertext Markup
                Language (HTML).
                <br />
                <br />
                Below this top layer, the transport layer connects applications
                on different hosts with a logical channel through the network.
                It provides this service with a variety of possible
                characteristics, such as ordered, reliable delivery (TCP), and
                an unreliable datagram service (UDP). Underlying these layers
                are the networking technologies that interconnect networks at
                their borders and exchange traffic across them. The Internet
                layer implements the Internet Protocol (IP) which enables
                computers to identify and locate each other by IP address, and
                route their traffic via intermediate (transit) networks.[68] The
                internet protocol layer code is independent of the type of
                network that it is physically running over. At the bottom of the
                architecture is the link layer, which connects nodes on the same
                physical link, and contains protocols that do not require
                routers for traversal to other links. The protocol suite does
                not explicitly specify hardware methods to transfer bits, or
                protocols to manage such hardware, but assumes that appropriate
                technology is available. Examples of that technology include
                Wi-Fi, Ethernet, and DSL.
                <br />
                <br />
                As user data is processed through the protocol stack, each
                abstraction layer adds encapsulation information at the sending
                host. Data is transmitted over the wire at the link level
                between hosts and routers. Encapsulation is removed by the
                receiving host. Intermediate relays update link encapsulation at
                each hop, and inspect the IP layer for routing purposes.
                <br />
                <br />
                <h4 className="mb-2 font-bold text-2xl">Internet protocol</h4>
                Conceptual data flow in a simple network topology of two hosts
                (A and B) connected by a link between their respective routers.
                The application on each host executes read and write operations
                as if the processes were directly connected to each other by
                some kind of data pipe. After the establishment of this pipe,
                most details of the communication are hidden from each process,
                as the underlying principles of communication are implemented in
                the lower protocol layers. In analogy, at the transport layer
                the communication appears as host-to-host, without knowledge of
                the application data structures and the connecting routers,
                while at the internetworking layer, individual network
                boundaries are traversed at each router. The most prominent
                component of the Internet model is the Internet Protocol (IP).
                IP enables internetworking and, in essence, establishes the
                Internet itself. Two versions of the Internet Protocol exist,
                IPV4 and IPV6.

                <h4 className="mb-2 font-bold text-2xl">IP Addresses</h4>
                A DNS resolver consults three name servers to resolve the domain
                name user-visible "www.wikipedia.org" to determine the IPV4
                Address 207.142.131.234 For locating individual computers on the
                network, the Internet provides IP addresses. IP addresses are
                used by the Internet infrastructure to direct internet packets
                to their destinations. They consist of fixed-length numbers,
                which are found within the packet. IP addresses are generally
                assigned to equipment either automatically via DHCP, or are
                configured. However, the network also supports other addressing
                systems. Users generally enter domain names (e.g.
                "en.wikipedia.org") instead of IP addresses because they are
                easier to remember, they are converted by the Domain Name System
                (DNS) into IP addresses which are more efficient for routing
                purposes.

                <h4 className="mb-2 text-2xl font-bold">IPv4</h4>
                Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) defines an IP address as a
                32-bit number.[68] IPv4 is the initial version used on the first
                generation of the Internet and is still in dominant use. It was
                designed to address up to ≈4.3 billion (109) hosts. However, the
                explosive growth of the Internet has led to IPv4 address
                exhaustion, which entered its final stage in 2011,[69] when the
                global IPv4 address allocation pool was exhausted.

                <br />
                <h4 className="mb-2 text-2xl font-bold">IPv6</h4>
                Because of the growth of the Internet and the depletion of
                available IPv4 addresses, a new version of IP IPv6, was
                developed in the mid-1990s, which provides vastly larger
                addressing capabilities and more efficient routing of Internet
                traffic. IPv6 uses 128 bits for the IP address and was
                standardized in 1998.[70][71][72] IPv6 deployment has been
                ongoing since the mid-2000s and is currently in growing
                deployment around the world, since Internet address registries
                (RIRs) began to urge all resource managers to plan rapid
                adoption and conversion.[73] IPv6 is not directly interoperable
                by design with IPv4. In essence, it establishes a parallel
                version of the Internet not directly accessible with IPv4
                software. Thus, translation facilities must exist for
                internetworking or nodes must have duplicate networking software
                for both networks. Essentially all modern computer operating
                systems support both versions of the Internet Protocol. Network
                infrastructure, however, has been lagging in this development.
                Aside from the complex array of physical connections that make
                up its infrastructure, the Internet is facilitated by bi- or
                multi-lateral commercial contracts, e.g., peering agreements,
                and by technical specifications or protocols that describe the
                exchange of data over the network. Indeed, the Internet is
                defined by its interconnections and routing policies.

                Creating a subnet by dividing the host identifier
                <br />
                <br />
                A subnetwork or subnet is a logical subdivision of an IP
                network.[74]:1,16 The practice of dividing a network into two or
                more networks is called subnetting. Computers that belong to a
                subnet are addressed with an identical most-significant
                bit-group in their IP addresses. This results in the logical
                division of an IP address into two fields, the network number or
                routing prefix and the rest field or host identifier. The rest
                field is an identifier for a specific host or network interface.
                <br />
                <br />
                The routing prefix may be expressed in Classless Inter-Domain
                Routing (CIDR) notation written as the first address of a
                network, followed by a slash character (/), and ending with the
                bit-length of the prefix. For example, 198.51.100.0/24 is the
                prefix of the Internet Protocol version 4 network starting at
                the given address, having 24 bits allocated for the network
                prefix, and the remaining 8 bits reserved for host addressing.
                Addresses in the range 198.51.100.0 to 198.51.100.255 belong to
                this network. The IPv6 address specification 2001:db8::/32 is a
                large address block with 296 addresses, having a 32-bit routing
                prefix.
                <br />
                <br />
                For IPv4, a network may also be characterized by its subnet mask
                or netmask, which is the bitmask that when applied by a bitwise
                AND operation to any IP address in the network, yields the
                routing prefix. Subnet masks are also expressed in dot-decimal
                notation like an address. For example, 255.255.255.0 is the
                subnet mask for the prefix 198.51.100.0/24. Traffic is exchanged
                between subnetworks through routers when the routing prefixes of
                the source address and the destination address differ. A router
                serves as a logical or physical boundary between the subnets.

                <br />
                The benefits of subnetting an existing network vary with each
                deployment scenario. In the address allocation architecture of
                the Internet using CIDR and in large organizations, it is
                necessary to allocate address space efficiently. Subnetting may
                also enhance routing efficiency, or have advantages in network
                management when subnetworks are administratively control
